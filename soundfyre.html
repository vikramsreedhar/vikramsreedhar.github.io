  <h1>Dropping a "hot" mixtape</H1>
  <p class="byline">By Vikram Sreedhar</p>
  <p>My friend and I decided to go to CalHacks 2.0 in October. Once we arrived at Cal, we met up with my friends who were letting us crash in their apartment and we got started on the ideation process right away. We had no idea what we wanted to hack on, but we all agreed we wanted to do something related to music. That's when I came up with the idea SoundFyre. What we created, was a music location service website that allows underground artists to upload their music onto a Google Map and see how "hot" their song is doing locally and globally. I'm very passionate about this project because my best friend in high school is an underground musician himself. </p>

<p>I was unsure about joining her team because I didn't speak Spanish and didn't know anything about this community. However, she reassured me that none of that mattered and this would be a cool experience for me. I gave in and decided I would join her team. I met my team and the community leaders soon after and became very close with all of them. The faculty members for the Chicano/Latino community were very caring and welcoming and immediately accepted me into their community family with no hesitation.</p>

<p>We presented our project to judges and other participants and we got a lot of great feedback and support! We really didn't expect people to like our project because we didn't intend on winning any prizes, we just created it for fun. However, once we saw how much buzz it was getting and found out that a company in Turkey copied our entire code onto their own website, we decided to turn this idea into a possible start-up. A CEO reached out to us and told us that if we made major updates and improvements to the site and maybe even create an app for it, he would be interested in funding us. I definitely learned that if you're passionate about a project or idea, you can definitely turn it into something big and spectacular.</p>
